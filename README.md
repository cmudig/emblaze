# Emblaze - Interactive Embedding Comparison

Emblaze is a Jupyter notebook widget for **visually comparing embeddings** using animated scatter plots. It bundles an easy-to-use Python API for performing dimensionality reduction on multiple sets of embedding data (including aligning the results for easier comparison), and a full-featured interactive platform for probing and comparing embeddings that runs within a Jupyter notebook cell.

## Installation

**Compatibility Note:** Note that this widget has been tested using Python >= 3.7. If you are using JupyterLab, please make sure you are running version 3.0 or higher.

Install Emblaze using `pip`:

```bash
pip install emblaze
```

The widget should work out of the box when you run `jupyter lab` (see example code below).

*Jupyter Notebook note:* If you are using Jupyter Notebook 5.2 or earlier, you may also need to enable
the nbextension:

```bash
jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix emblaze
```

## Standalone Demo

Although the full application is designed to work as a Jupyter widget, you can run a standalone version (with some features currently limited) directly in your browser. To do so, simply run the following command after installing the package:

```bash
python -m emblaze.server
```

Visit `localhost:5000` to see the running application. This will allow you to view two demo datasets: one showing five different t-SNE projections of a subset of MNIST digits, and one showing embeddings of the same 5,000 words according to three different data sources (Google News, Wikipedia, and Twitter). To add your own datasets to this demo application, you can copy a directory containing `data.json` and optional `thumbnails.json` files into the data path printed when the Flask server starts. (To generate these JSON files, simply build an `EmbeddingSet` and a `Thumbnails` object using the Python API, then call the `to_json()` method on each one and save it to a file.)

## Examples

Please see `examples/example.ipynb` to try using the Emblaze widget on the Boston housing prices or MNIST (TensorFlow import required) datasets.

**Example 1: Multiple projections of the same embedding dataset.** This can reveal areas of variation in the dimensionality reduction process, since tSNE and UMAP are randomized algorithms.

```python
import emblaze
from emblaze.utils import Field, ProjectionTechnique

# X is an n x k array, Y is a length-n array
X, Y = ...

# Represent the high-dimensional embedding
emb = emblaze.Embedding({Field.POSITION: X, Field.COLOR: Y})
# Compute nearest neighbors in the high-D space
emb.compute_neighbors(metric='euclidean')

# Generate UMAP 2D representations - you can pass UMAP parameters to project()
variants = emblaze.EmbeddingSet([
    emb.project(method=ProjectionTechnique.UMAP) for _ in range(10)
])

w = emblaze.Viewer(embeddings=variants)
w
```

**Example 2: Multiple embeddings of the same data from different models.** This is useful to see how different models embed data differently.

```python
# Xs is a list of n x k arrays corresponding to different embedding spaces
Xs = ...
# Y is a length-n array of labels for color-coding
Y = ...
# List of strings representing the name of each embedding space (e.g.
# "Google News", "Wikipedia", "Twitter"). Omit to use generic names
embedding_names = [...]

# Make high-dimensional embedding objects
embeddings = emblaze.EmbeddingSet([
    emblaze.Embedding({Field.POSITION: X, Field.COLOR: Y}, label=emb_name)
    for X, emb_name in zip(Xs, embedding_names)
])
embeddings.compute_neighbors()

# Make aligned UMAP
reduced = embeddings.project(method=ProjectionTechnique.ALIGNED_UMAP)

w = emblaze.Viewer(embeddings=reduced)
w
```

**Example 3: Visualizing image data with image thumbnails.** The viewer will display image previews for each point as well as its nearest neighbors. (For text data, you can use `TextThumbnails` to show small pieces of text next to the points.)

```python
# images is an n x 100 x 100 x 3 numpy array of 100x100 RGB images (values from 0-255)
images = ...
thumbnails = emblaze.ImageThumbnails(images)
w = emblaze.Viewer(embeddings=embeddings, thumbnails=thumbnails)
w
```

### Interactive Analysis

Once you have loaded a `Viewer` instance in the notebook, you can read and write its properties to dynamically work with the visualization. The following properties are reactive:

- `embeddings` (`EmbeddingSet`) Modify this to change the entire dataset that is displayed.
- `thumbnails` (`Thumbnails`) Represents the image or text thumbnails displayed on hover and click.
- `currentFrame` (`int`) The current frame or embedding space that is being viewed (from `0` to `len(embeddings)`).
- `selectedIDs` (`List[int]`) The selected ID numbers. Unless you provide custom IDs when constructing the `EmbeddingSet`, these are simply zero-indexed integers.
- `alignedIDs` (`List[int]`) The IDs of the points to which the embedding spaces are aligned (same format as `selectedIDs`). Alignment is computed relative to the positions of the points in the current frame.
- `colorScheme` (`string`) The name of a color scheme to use to render the points. A variety of color schemes are available, listed in `src/colorschemes.ts`. This property can also be changed in the Settings panel of the widget.
- `previewMode` (`string`) The method to use to generate preview lines, which should be one of the values in `utils.

## Development Installation

Clone repository, then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the python package. This will also build the JS packages.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Run the following commands if you use **Jupyter Lab**:

```
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager --no-build
jupyter labextension install .
```

Run the following commands if you use **Jupyter Notebook**:

```
jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --symlink --overwrite --py emblaze
jupyter nbextension enable --sys-prefix --py emblaze
```

Note that the `--symlink` flag doesn't work on Windows, so you will here have to run
the `install` command every time that you rebuild your extension. For certain installations
you might also need another flag instead of `--sys-prefix`, but we won't cover the meaning
of those flags here.

### How to see your changes

Open JupyterLab in watch mode with `jupyter lab --watch`. Then, in a separate terminal, watch the source directory for changes with `npm run watch`. After a change to the JavaScript code, you will wait for the build to finish, then refresh your browser. After changing in Python code, you will need to restart the notebook kernel to see your changes take effect.

To develop using the standalone app, run `npm run watch:standalone` in a separate terminal from the Flask server to continuously build the frontend. You will need to reload the page to see your changes.

### Development Notes

- Svelte transitions don't seem to work well as they force an expensive re-layout operation. Avoid using them during interactions.
